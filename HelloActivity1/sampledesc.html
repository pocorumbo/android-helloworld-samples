<h3>Simple Activity </h3>
<p> This sample code shows how to create a very basic application with a single Activity. Activity is the 
visible component of your application ie. it is what the user interacts with. 
Every activity should be declared inside the AndroidManifest.xml file with <activity> tag. 
Click the AndroidManifest.xml tab to see the declaration of our HelloActivity. 
Next, we define HelloActivity by subclassing Activity class in HelloActivity1.java. 
</p>
<p>
Every Activity has UI, for this app we create a Textbox in our Java file. It is recommended to create
layouts in xml but we will get to it in the next sample. For now to keep things simple, we creating 
our UI in the Java file itself. Then, we set our UI in Activity's window by using setContentView().
