@title:Activity with layout xml

<p> In the previous sample app, we defined our layout in the java file itself because our layout was very simple. 
But most of the times our layouts won't be that simple, and defining them in xml would be easier. This sample app shows just how to do that.
</p>
<p>
Check out the layout declaration for our HelloActivity in the main.xml file. We define the same TextView as before, within a LinearLayout. 
LinearLayout is a layout container, 
there are many layout containers like RelativeLayout, TableLayout, FrameLayout, etc. As the name suggests they are used to hold other Views in your UI.
</p>

<p> As before, we set the layout defined in main.xml to HelloActivity's window by calling setContentView(). The only difference, is the argument passed to 
setContentView() -- R.layout.main -- this is the auto generated id for our layout file on compilation.
