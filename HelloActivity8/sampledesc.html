<h3>Saving Activity's per-instance state</h3>

<p> onSaveInstanceState() is used for persisting state that is relevant to a particular Activity when it is destroyed
and restarted. One such scenario is with you change device orientation
while interacting with your Activity. </p>

onPause() instead of onSaveInstanceState(). Next sample application shows how to use it.
