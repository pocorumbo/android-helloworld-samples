<h3>Simple Activity </h3>
<p> This sample code shows how to create a very basic application with a single Activity, we will call it HelloActivity.
Activity is the visible component of an application ie. it is what the user interacts with. 
An activity is declared inside the AndroidManifest.xml file with an &lt;activity&gt; tag. 
Click the AndroidManifest.xml tab to see the declaration of our HelloActivity. 
Our HelloActivity is defined in HelloActivity1.java by extending the Activity class. 
</p>
<p>
Next, UI is a important component of an Activity, for our Activity we will create a TextView in our Java file. Generally, is recommended to create
layouts in xml but we will get to it in the next sample. For now to keep things simple, we are defining 
our UI in the Java file itself. The UI elements in Android framework are known to as Views. 
We will set our UI in Activity's window by using setContentView().
