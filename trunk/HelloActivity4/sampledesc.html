<h3>Activity launches another Activity</h3>

<p> So far, we worked with a single Activity in our application. But most of the times you will be using more than one Activity in your app.
Either startActivity() or startActivityForResult() can be used to launch another Activity from your current Activity.
When you use startActivity(), you wont get back results(sucess code or data) from the newly launched Activity. If you 
want to get back results, use startActivityForResult(). See the next sample on using startActivityForResult().
</p>
<p>
In this app we will be using startActivity(). Notice the use of setClass() for Intent created for launching another Activity.  </a>.
This kind of Intent is called implicit Intent, and should be used if your new Activity is in the same Application. To learn more about 
Intents and implicit/explicit Intents see the <a href = "http://code.google.com/android/reference/android/content/Intent.html">reference docs for Intent
</a>.
