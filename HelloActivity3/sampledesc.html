<p> We will now extend our HelloActivity to use string resources defined in res/values/strings.xml. Check out the strings.xml file. 
In our layout xml file we can retreive this string resources by using syntax like @string/&lt;id&gt;, where id is the auto generated id for this string resource.
</p>
<p>
Defining these strings as resources instead of hardcoding them makes it easier to support alternative languages and configurations.
