<h3>Activity launches an Activity and gets back results.</h3>

<p>This sample from the ApiDemos shows how to get back results from the launched Activity 
in launching Activity using startActivityForResults(). 
It can be used, for example, to implement 
a dialog allowing the user to
pick an e-mail address or image -- the picking activity sends the selected
data back to the originating activity when done.</p>

<p>The example here is composed of two activities: ReceiveResult launches
the picking activity and receives its results; SendResult allows the user
to pick something and sends the selection back to its caller.  Implementing
this functionality involves the
{@link android.app.Activity#setResult setResult()} method for sending a
result and
{@link android.app.Activity#onActivityResult onActivityResult()} to
receive it.</p>
